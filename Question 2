"""
@Because there is multiple test cases that's why I am using script style.
@Here we need to find out how many of them are much more higher than K.
@As K is provided so we can directly compare it and withing for loop and with the if condition we can count that how many are higher than K.
@Now in main() we are taking T as the test case input. N, K in a line space separated; N for total many player and K is the height of Gi-Hun and Ali. Gi-Hun and Ali have same height.
@Then we are calling out questionTwo funtion and returni g the answer.
