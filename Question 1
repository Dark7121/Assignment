@First I am taking an input.
@Second I am changing the type of input. From Int --> Str.
@Then I am diving it so I got the last 3 digits; Because as per Indian Curreny Notations there will be a comma before the last 3 digits.
@2 + i * 2: This is the starting index for slicing the reversed string reverse. It starts at index 2 and then increments by 2 for each iteration of the loop.
@4 + i * 2: This is the ending index for slicing the reversed string reverse. It starts at index 4 and also increments by 2 for each iteration of the loop.
@After out of the loop again reversed and added the both part with .join(); Returning the answer
